This project demonstrates a full-stack application with a React frontend, a Java backend utilizing Spring Boot, and a MongoDB database. The application leverages Docker Compose for a streamlined development and deployment experience.

Prerequisites:

Docker Desktop: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
Docker Compose: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
Node.js and npm (or yarn): https://nodejs.org/en
Java Development Kit (JDK): https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/
Basic understanding of React, Java, Spring Boot, and MongoDB

Explanation:

Services:
client: Builds the React application image using the Dockerfile in the frontend directory. Exposes port 3000 and mounts the local frontend directory as a volume for development convenience.
server: Builds the Spring Boot application image using the Dockerfile in the backend directory. Exposes port 8080, sets the SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_URI environment variable for connecting to MongoDB, and depends on the mongo service to ensure the database is ready.
mongo: Uses the official mongo:latest image to run a MongoDB instance. Exposes port 27017 and optionally defines a volume (mongo-data) to persist data.
Volumes:
The client service mounts the local frontend directory as a volume, allowing for code changes to reflect within the container without rebuilding the image.
The mongo-data volume (uncomment in docker-compose.yml if desired) persists MongoDB data between container restarts.

4. Running the Application:

Open a terminal in the project directory.
Run docker-compose up -d to build and start all services in detached mode.
The frontend application should be accessible at http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
The backend API will be available at http://localhost:8080 (endpoints specific to your Spring Boot application).

5. Development Workflow:

Code changes in the frontend directory will be reflected automatically due to the volume mounting.
For changes in the backend directory, you'll need to rebuild the image using docker-compose build backend and then restart the service with docker-compose up -d.
